Next, you'll need to setup at webdrivers for Chrome and Safari to run the tests.

# Setup Chrome WebDriver

# Setup Safari WebDriver

# Running tests

Before running the tests, choose the browser by setting the environment variable (by default, tests will choose Chrome):

```
export BROWSER=chrome
# or
export BROWSER=safari
```

To run all tests, use this command.

```
python -m pytest
```

You should see output like this:
