# Development

* Create virtualenv and install requirements using:

```

Next, you'll need to setup at webdrivers for Chrome and Safari to run the tests.

# Setup Chrome WebDriver

Download and install Chrome webdriver from chromium site [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)

# Setup Safari WebDriver

Please follow instructions from Apple [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/testing_with_webdriver_in_safari)

# Running tests

Before running the tests, choose the browser by setting the environment variable (by default, tests will choose Chrome):

```
export BROWSER=chrome
# or
export BROWSER=safari
```

To run all tests, use this command.

```
python -m pytest
```

You should see output like this:
